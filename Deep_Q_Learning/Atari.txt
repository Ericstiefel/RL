Observation Space:
Box(0,255,(210,160,3), unit8)
Array with 8bit ranging in [0,255] with observations of size (210,160,3)

Action Space: Discrete(6)
0: None
1: Fire
2: Right
3: Left
4: Right Fire
5: Left Fire

Reward: 
Gain points for killing aliens, with the farthest away resulting in most
Reward of 200+ is completion bound
